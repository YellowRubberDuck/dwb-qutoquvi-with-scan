dwb-qutoquvi-with-scan
======================

Modification of dwb autoquvi extension that enables to scan embedded videos and play it in mplayer (without flash or html5)


Adobe flash sucks. HTML5 sucks for playing videos. Basically main problem is that you have to use
keyboard and waste awfully a lot of cpu on preprocessing instead of just playing video and 
have possibility to use your keyboard shortcuts always - you have to go forward - you press left arrow.

Do on thing and do it well - without any ads, colorful boxes or loading bars and complicated buttons.

So basicaly I modified dwb extension autoquvi, created by Stefan Bolte. It works quite well, but I missed
that I can only play videos on such websites as youtube or vimeo. I wanted to play that  embedded videos,
so when I get to the website with that I type :qutoquvi and it is immedietly streamed to mplayer. 

File autoquvi should be placed in your ~/.local/share/dwb/extensions/ directory
